## Overview 

HTML, CSS and JS are given for a loan calculator. The goal is to fill in the JS to make the loan calculator functional. The calculator takes an amount to loan (the principle), a term in years, and a yearly rate. The output should be the monthly payment of the loan.

-   ***P*** = Amount of principle
-   ***i*** = periodic interest rate (in our case yearly rate ÷ 12)
-   ***n*** = total number of payments (years × 12)

There is also a jasmine test file (calculator-test.js). The goal is to write tests for the calculateMontlyPayment function. There are a few suggested tests,feel free to think of more, add to it.
